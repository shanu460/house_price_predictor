# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on several features like the number of rooms, poverty level, and pupil-teacher ratio using a Random Forest Regression model.

## Features Used
- Average number of rooms (`rm`)
- Percentage of lower status population (`lstat`)
- Pupil-teacher ratio (`ptratio`)

## How it works
- Loads the Boston Housing dataset.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Trains a Random Forest Regression model on the training data.
- Predicts house prices on the test data.
- Visualizes actual vs predicted prices with a scatter plot.
